# GreedyFHist
GreedyFHist - Registration of stained histology images.

# Important!

This code needs some more tweaking before it can be used properly. These are the features that will be released within the next 2-4 weeks (i.e. until mid of July):

- Proper installation script (with some information on how to install greedy).
- Proper documentation
- Proper command line interface.
- Tutorial.
- Maybe some additional features.


TODO:
- Split affine and nonrigid options.
- Test functionality.
